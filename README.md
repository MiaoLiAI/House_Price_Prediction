# Hose Price Prediction
#### This project develops a machine learning solution for predicting housing prices using multiple regression models. Through systematic hyperparameter tuning and optimization, we achieved a target accuracy of 80% across all evaluated models.
##### Methodology & Model Selection
I implemented and compared four distinct machine learning approaches:

Polynomial Regression with SGD Optimization

Applied polynomial feature expansion (degree=2) to capture non-linear relationships

Implemented Stochastic Gradient Descent with adaptive learning rate scheduling

Utilized L2 regularization (α=0.001) to prevent overfitting

Regularized Linear Models

Compared Ridge and Lasso regression techniques

Systematically tuned regularization parameters for optimal bias-variance tradeoff

Ensemble Methods

Employed Random Forest regression with feature importance analysis

Optimized tree depth, number of estimators, and minimum sample splits

Gradient Boosting Approach

Implemented gradient boosting regressors with early stopping mechanisms

Fine-tuned learning rates and maximum depth parameters
