## Hose Price Prediction
#### This project develops a machine learning solution for predicting housing prices using multiple regression models. Through systematic hyperparameter tuning and optimization, we achieved a target accuracy of 80% across all evaluated models.
##### Methodology & Model Selection：
I implemented and compared four distinct machine learning approaches:
1: Polynomial Regression with SGD Optimization
2: Regularized Linear Models
3: Ensemble Methods
4: Gradient Boosting Approach
